                <h3>Undergraduate Research Assistant</h3>
                <p><em>Trinity College Engineering Department (April 2025 – Current)</em></p>
                <p>
                    Undergraduate research assistant for Prof. Taikang Ning’s lab. Working in analysing nonlinear dynamics 
                    in hippocampal EEG during REM sleep in animals of different age groups. I write the research papers and do 
                    the corresponding analysis employing spectral and chaotic analysis in MATLAB and running the algorithms in FORTRAN. <br>
                    Conference paper accepted for presentation at CISP-BMEI 2025 (Qingdao, China) titled: <i>Developmental Differences in 
                    Hippocampal EEG During REM Sleep: A Chaotic and Spectral Analysis.</i>

                <h3>Undergraduate Summer Research Assistant</h3>
                <p><em>Trinity College Department of Physics (May 2025 – July 2025)</em></p>
                <p> Worked on the Physics Department at Trinity College on a high-speed photon coincidence 
                    detection system using an Alchitry Au Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA and a Python-based interface. As a team we
                    managed to overclock the FPGA from its base-clock of 100 MHz to 300 MHz by using PLLs, critical
                    path timing slack restructuring, and optimising the finite state machines. By overclocking the FPGA, we
                    achieved an increase in the maximum rate of photon coincidence detection from 40 MHz to 110 MHz which
                    counts for a x2.75 improvement in detection speed. Similarly, the minimum time window
                    to detect a coincidence was decreased from 10 ns to 3.33 ns. <br>
                    This particularly aligns with my career endeavours, as I bridge software and hardware 
                    by developing low-level Verilog logic for real-time signal processing and sending it using UART 
                    for higher-level tools such as data visualisation and analysis. The application of this 
                    technology bridges the budget gap for physics laboratories for optics and photonics experiments,
                    having an open-software and open-hardware approach where professors can access our platform online,
                    purchase the required hardware, and just download the files to install and start using.</p>
